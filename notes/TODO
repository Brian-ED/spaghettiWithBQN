Objectives:
    moving as much of the code to the BQN side as possible. 

BQN:
    finish the PyFunc so you can use python functions in bqn more easily.
    finish MsgExists in the comm namespace.
    
    maybe:
        make a BQN array type and change the dunder methods to be more inline with what bqn would do.


Python:
    ✔️Make numpy arrays work better. bit vauge, but basically numpy has it's own types like int32 for stuff that needs handling.
    ✔️Add infinity and nan type support.
    test invalid inputs
    Add type safety and custom errors for them.
    Add more test cases.

Bugs:
    For unknown reasons, when running the bqn code using Code Runner vs-code extention, the Popen function in BQN.py breaks. running from terminal works.
    •Show breaks a lot of things in the BQN function in BQN.py. I need to switch off of using std-out as output for python side to get as input.
