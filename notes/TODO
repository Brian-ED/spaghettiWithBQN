Objectives:
    moving as much of the code to the BQN side as possible. 

BQN:
    finish the PyFunc so you can use python functions in bqn more easily.
    finish MsgExists in the comm namespace.
    remove â€¢BQN in ToInt function


Python:
    Make numpy arrays work better. bit vauge, but basically numpy has it's own types for stuff that needs handling.
    Add type safety and custom errors for them.
    Add more test cases.
    Add infinity and nan type support (or add an error indicating it isn't possible).

Bugs:
    No known bugs.
