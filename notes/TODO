Intermediary type (mediary for short) means converting any type from both BQN and python to a list of strings
where first string shows types of the elements, and the rest of the strings are string representations of each element


Convert from python to the intermediary type (list of strings)
Convert from intermediary type to BQN
Convert from BQN to intermediary type
Convert from intermediary type to python again


✓✓ converting from intermediary type:
    ✓✓ solving the types:
        grouping intigers  BQN ✓  python ✓
        grouping arrays    BQN ✓  python ✓
    
    ✓✓ Mapping types to proper elements in each language:
        BQN ✓  python ✓ 

converting to intermediary type:
    solving the types:
        grouping intigers  BQN 𝕩  python 𝕩
        grouping arrays    BQN 𝕩  python 𝕩
    
    Mapping types to proper elements in each language:
        BQN 𝕩  python 𝕩



Types that work already without intermediary type:
    str, list[str] ✓
    numpy/BQN arrays, python iterable[any], intigers 𝕩



BQN:
    CollapseInts in .bqn can be massively simplified
