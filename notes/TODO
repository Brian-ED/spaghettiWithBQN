Intermediary type (mediary for short) means converting any type from both BQN and python to a list of strings
where first string shows types of the elements, and the rest of the strings are string representations of each element

BQN:
    CollapseInts in .bqn can be massively simplified.
    add PyFuncStruct.run so you can use python function in bqn more easily.
Python:
    Make numpy arrays work better. bit vauge, but basically numpy has it's own types for stuff that needs handling.
    Add type safety and custom errors for them.
    Add more test cases

Bugs:
    None yet.
