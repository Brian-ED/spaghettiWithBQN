Intermediary type (mediary for short) means converting any type from both BQN and python to a list of strings
where first string shows types of the elements, and the rest of the strings are string representations of each element

BQN:
    CollapseInts in .bqn can be massively simplified
    consider adding dictionaries as a type by representing them as 2 row arrays.

Python:
    Make numpy arrays work better.
    add type safety and custom errors for them.
